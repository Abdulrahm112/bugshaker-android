# BugShaker-Android

Send Android bug reports via email. Shake to summon!

# Introduction

BugShaker-Android allows your users to simply submit bug reports by shaking their device.
When a shake is detected, the current screen state is captured and the user is
prompted to submit a bug report via a mail composer with the screenshot attached.

The iOS version of BugShaker was written by [Dan Trenz](https://github.com/dtrenz) and is available [here](https://github.com/detroit-labs/BugShaker). This Android version builds on Square's shake-detection library, [seismic](https://github.com/square/seismic).

# Getting Started

(1) Specify BugShaker-Android as a dependency in your build.gradle file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.stkent:bugshaker:0.3.0'
}
```

(2) Configure `BugShaker` in your custom `Application` class, and call `start()` to begin listening for shakes:

```java
public class CustomApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        BugShaker.get(this)
                 .setEmailAddresses("someone@example.com")   // required
                 .setEmailSubjectLine("Custom Subject Line") // optional
                 .setLoggingEnabled(BuildConfig.DEBUG)       // optional
                 .setIgnoreFlagSecure(true)                  // optional
                 .start();                                   // required
    }

}
```

It is recommended that logging always be disabled in production builds.

## Issue Tracking

Library issues are tracked using GitHub Issues. Please review all tag types to understand issue categorization.

Always review open issues before opening a new one. If you would like to work on an existing issue, please comment to that effect and assign yourself to the issue.

## Conventions

Code committed to this project must pass selected style and correctness checks provided by:

- [FindBugsâ„¢](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/);
- [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/);
- [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/).

This helps us focus on content only when reviewing contributions.

You can run these checks locally by executing the following Gradle command:

```shell
./gradlew checkLocal
```

Travis CI runs the same checks for each pull request and marks the build as failing if any check does not pass. Detailed information about every detected violation will be automatically posted to the conversation for that pull request. Violation detection and reporting is handled by the [gnag](https://github.com/btkelly/gnag) Gradle plugin.

## Generating Inline Licenses

Before opening a pull request, you must generate license headers in any new source files by executing the Gradle command:

    ./gradlew licenseFormat

The Travis CI pull request build will fail if any source file is missing this generated header.
